abstract = {In this article, we describe GPU-Quicksort, an efficient Quicksort algorithm suitable for highly parallel multicore graphics processors. Quicksort has previously been considered an inefficient sorting solution for graphics processors, but we show that in CUDA, NVIDIA's programing platform for general-purpose computations on graphical processors, GPU-Quicksort performs better than the fastest-known sorting implementations for graphics processors, such as radix and bitonic sort. Quicksort can thus be seen as a viable alternative for sorting large quantities of data on graphics processors.},
